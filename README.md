# Gwent++ ⚔️  👾

This project is a card game... for programmers! 💻  Yep, you'll be seeing a terminal if you want to play.

It's built with Unity (although it's not set up to build for Windows right now). You'll need Unity to open the project.

## The Game 

Gwent++ is a simple, fast-paced card game. Each card has damage and a special ability (or not).  The player with the most points wins the round, and the first to win three rounds takes the game.

## The Special Sauce: Custom Cards

One of the most fun parts of Gwent++ is that you can create your own cards to play with! You can edit existing decks or build your own from scratch.

To make this possible, we ventured into the world of compilers! 🚀  You can now declare your own Card and Effects within the game.  (There's a presentation in Spanish about how the compiler works, if you're interested.) 

## More Than Meets the Eye

Gwent++ has also evolved since its first semester version🤠. It's much better organized, taking advantage of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## The Future

This project has a lot of potential!  Here are some things we'd love to add in the future:

* **LAN Multiplayer:** Play against your friends! 🤝 
* **AI Opponent:**  Train your skills against a computer opponent! 🤖

Let me know if you have any questions about the code or how to get started! 😄
